Introduction
This tool is designed for extracting skeletons from humans in videos. It serves as a straightforward solution for analyzing human poses by overlaying skeletons onto the video footage of individuals.

Repository Contents
Within this repository, you will find two sample videos showcasing workers performing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) related to the defect inspection process. These SOPs include critical tasks such as visual inspection and various modification works, highlighting the application of this video processing tool in practical, real-world scenarios.
